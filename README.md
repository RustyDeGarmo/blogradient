# blogradient
WordPress theme that started with an Udemy course 

The course I started with is called Bootstrap to Wordpress by Brad Hussey @ https://www.udemy.com/course/bootstrap-to-wordpress/
The course uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Bootstrap, Kirki Customizer, and Elementor. I learned a lot while going through the course, but it is a little outdated as I write this. Elementor has been updated and the custom widgets created during the course no longer function.

That's part of what this repo is for. I'm going to update the Elementor section so that I can use the custom widgets and then more! The theme will continue to be updated to make it mine.

A live version of Blogradient can be viewed @ https://www.trainfinance.com depending on when you view. (That site hasn't activated the theme yet)
